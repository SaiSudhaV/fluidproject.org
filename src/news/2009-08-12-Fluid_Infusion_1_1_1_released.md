Infusion 1.1.1 is here! This release is a maintenance release, which means no new features were added but several
bugs were fixed for our Inline Edit and Reorderer components. Infusion 1.1.1 is an incremental upgrade and preserves
backwards compatibility for all production-grade components.

### What is Fluid Infusion

Fluid Infusion is an application framework for building usable and accessible user interfaces with JavaScript. Built
on top of jQuery, Infusion takes a different approach to client-side development. At heart, Infusion is an open
architecture designed to put you back in control of your application’s user experience. It includes a growing
collection of UI components —reusable interactions that go deeper than most widgets. Created by a community
of developers and interaction designers, Infusion components are built from the ground up with accessibility
in mind. All of our designs can be used with assistive technologies, are fully controllable with the keyboard,
and can be transformed to suit your users’ personal needs.

Fluid Infusion includes a collection of our UI components, tutorials to help you get started,
solid APIs to help you
dive in, and the community to lend a hand.
