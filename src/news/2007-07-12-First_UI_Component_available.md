Fluid's first UI component, the Lightbox, has been built and was demonstrated at the June 2007 Sakai
conference in Amsterdam and at the JA-SIG conference in Denver.
The Lightbox allows users to re-organize images within a collection by dragging-and-dropping thumbnails.
The Lightbox is fully keyboard accessible, providing non-mouse users with a direct and convenient way
of re-ordering images with the arrow keys. Part of the Sakai Image Gallery Tool, the Lightbox is the
first instance of Fluid's reusable drag-and-drop accessibility library, which can be used by developers
to implement a wide range of user interfaces in which the user can directly manipulate and re-order
objects on-screen.
Detailed [technical and design documentation](http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Lightbox+Component)
for the Lightbox is available. See also, the
[slides from the Fluid presentation](http://confluence.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/CONF07/An+Introduction+to+the+FLUID+Project)
given at the Sakai conference.
